I first learned Python in 2006 during high school. Unfortunately, I chosed the 'easiest' way learning it. I was just quickly scanning _Dive into Python_ and enjoying the thoughts like "wow Python is so convinient and has so much more features than C and C++", without bothering to write a single line of Python code.

Of course I learned completely nothing about Python in high school, except that the idea "Python seems like a good idea".
