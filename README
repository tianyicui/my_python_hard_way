I first learned Python in 2006 during high school. Unfortunately, I chosed the 'easiest' way learning it. I was just quickly scanning _Dive into Python_ and enjoying the thoughts like "wow Python is so convinient and has so much more features than C and C++", without bothering to write a single line of Python code.

Of course I learned completely nothing about Python in high school, except that the idea "Python seems like a good idea".

In college, I learned a little more about Python as well as various other programming languages. By the end of my freshman year, I was so proud and excited when I made $800 (my first small fortune!) by working overnight to add features to a commercial Django website.

But I was not a good Python programmer. I was simply depended on Googling (thanks to the amazing Django documentations!), trial-and-error (thanks to Python the dynamic language letting me do it easily and quickly), and the client's lack of ability to judge my code quality.
